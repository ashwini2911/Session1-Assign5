1. Explain the main sources of Data flood.
2. What is the difference between Data and Big data.
3. What are main reasons behind hadoop becoming the solution for Data explosion.


Ans 1- Data flood is coming from many sources-
a. Stock Exchange
b. Bank
c. Social Networking Sites
d. Genealogy sites
e. Internet Archive
f. Shopping websites

Ans 2- Difference between data and Bigdata-
-Basic difference between data and big data is just in the volume of data.
-Data is collection of meaningful facts and figures and same is Bigdata just the difference is data is in small volume or size while Bigdata is in large volume or size.
-Size for data files may be in MB or GB but Bigdata is very large in size like TB and PB.
-Processing data is easy and fast but procesing Big Data is complex and slow.
-Data is easy to store, process and analyse while Big Data is difficult to store,process and analyse.


Ans 3- Hadoop is an open source, java based programming framework which supports distributed procesing.
Distributed processing is the solution to store and process large volume of data which cant be processed on a single machine and hadoop provides this feature of distributed processing.
Hadoop provides reliable,scalable plateform to process Big data.
Hadoop is capable of processing Petabytes of data by distributing the load on multiple machines to process it fastly.
Hadoop is also responsible to manage nodes failure and load balancing is done automatically by Hadoop.
Hadoop distributes the data on multiple machines and sends the code to process it, after processing the data it collects the result from multiple machines and assemble it to produce concatenated result.
